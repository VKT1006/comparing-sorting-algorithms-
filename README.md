# Comparing traditional sorting algorithms with artificial intelligence based approaches.
In this repo I am comparing traditional sorting algorithms; bubble sort, heap sort, insertion sort and merge sort with AI based approaches. The first AI algorithm used in this repo is Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. And the plan is to use 3 more AI algorithms which are; Genetic Algorith, KSO and Cuckoo. 

Note: I my world Java is the language that God's use. If you don't like my Python style, that's your problem. Use Java and recommend it to all your friends. Stay save let the lord be with you.
